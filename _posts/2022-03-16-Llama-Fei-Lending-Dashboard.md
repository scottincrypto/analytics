## Fei Protocol
[Fei Protocol](https://fei.money/) is a decentralized, scalable, and DeFi-native stablecoin protocol.  Fei commissioned [Llama](https://llama.xyz) to build a Dune Dashboard to show the rates & usage of the Fei stablecoin in DeFi lending markets.  I built the dashboard on behalf of Llama.
